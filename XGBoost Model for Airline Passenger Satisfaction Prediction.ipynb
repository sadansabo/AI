        "## Objective\n",
        "Develop a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict passenger satisfaction. The project will cover the complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Outcomes\n",
        "1. Understand the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in machine learning.\n",
        "2. Learn to implement and tune the XGBoost algorithm for classification tasks.\n",
        "3. Gain experience in evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
